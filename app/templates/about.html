<h1 id="about-this-blog">About this blog</h1>

<p>At the time when Internet was just starting to develop, computers were not owned by everyone, and ActiveX and Flash were fresh and applied all over the Internet, personal blog was something fashional for Internet users. They were used to writing something on the blogs, with pictures, and decorated them with varieties of themes. Some bloggers simply recorded their personal lives as what we do now in social media. Some dalaos filled their blogs with knowledge, teaching people a lot. And some dalaos even decorated their blogs with tons of animations, colors and weird shapes at the time when HTML5/CSS3 didn’t exist and network speed was poor, impressing the viewers most of whom were just new to this fancy world. </p>

<p>I always want to have a personal blog. I keep trying to find the blog that suits me from online providers, like wordpress, lofter, even QQZone, but (maybe for the reason that I don’t know) none satisify me. Meanwhile, I found building a blog a benefitial, interesting, but tough and challenging task. If I built and maintained the blog BUILT BY MYSELF, I would never be limited, by functions, themes or costs. I could implement whatever functions I want, decorated whatever I want, and kept up with the rapidly developing technical trend. But it was so hard and complicated that I even dared not get started.</p>

<p>But I just want it!</p>

<p>In the November and December of 2016, I learned and wrote the first version (maybe prototype?) of my blog with Flask and jQuery and successfully deployed it on DigitalOcean, The knowledge I learned from it helps me to build <a href="http://njuadmin.tk">NJUAdmin</a> in a week. Now it is simple and easy to learn, but has some fatal disadvantages that forces me to rebuild it with better and more modern technologies.</p>

<ol>
<li>Poor modularity</li>
<li>Limited language features</li>
<li>Difficulty in maintenance and further development</li>
<li>Lack of modern work flow</li>
</ol>

<p>Considering that the features that <a href="http://njuadmin.tk">NJUAdmin</a> consists of requires modularity to function well, I am now rewriting my blog mainly with the following stack:</p>

<ol>
<li>Front-end: <strong>React, Redux and other components in React ecosystem, Typescript, Ant-design</strong></li>
<li>Back-end: <strong>ASP.NET Core+ MongoDB/SQL Server</strong></li>
<li>Host: <strong>DigitalOcean</strong>, may move to <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> in the future</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a hard and long way to rebuild and perfect this project, but until Jan 7, 2017, all functions in the prototype version have been implemented, and I am planning to publish a new version when comment system is ready.</p>
